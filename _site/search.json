    "text": "The original sources for our dataset, the Gender Data Portal, are national governments and major international organizations that collect official disaggregated gender statistics. These sources include organizations like national statistical offices, labor and health ministries, and agencies responsible for education and population data. At the international level, much of the data comes from the United Nations (UNDP, UNICEF, UN Women), UNESCO, the International Labour Organization (ILO), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). These organizations gather standardized data from member countries, which the World Bank then combines and organizes in the Gender Data Portal so people can easily compare information across countries.\nThe World Bank Group is the organization that funded the creation of the dataset. More specifically, the World Bank’s Gender Group and the Development Economics Data Group compiled this data and updated it 4 times a year. In addition, a combination of multi-donor trust funds, such as the Umbrella Facility for Gender Equality, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, etc, that have donated individual contributions for years.\nThe dataset from 2000-2023 illuminated the complex relationship between gender equality, education, health and economic development of different countries through the following variable categories:\n\nHuman Capital & Health: Indicators related to population health, healthcare access, and overall human capital development. These variables reflect overall human capital through the female-specific human capital index\nWomen’s Autonomy and Reproductive Health: These variables measure women’s empowerment in personal and reproductive decision-making and assess the degree of autonomy, reproductive rights, and access to reproductive health services among women.\nEconomic Indicators: These variables focus on the broader economic environment, income distribution, and the inclusiveness of economic growth.\nPopulation & Demographic: The demographic variables provide basic structural information about a country’s population, including total population size and the proportion of females.\nEducation: Education indicators reflect gender parity and access to schooling across different levels. These variables provide insights into gender equality in educational attainment and investment in human capital formation.\nLabor Force & Education Level: Labor force indicators describe the distribution of educational attainment among working-age populations, disaggregated by gender.\nGender Equality & Institutional Factors: These variables include institutional-level measures of gender equality\n\nVariables such as Human Capital Index (HCI), literacy rates, and school enrollment gender parity depicted the pattern of females getting education and their success. Index related with prenatal care, reproductive decision-making, and out-of-pocket health expenditures highlighted the fact that in many parts of the world, women are facing medical and health related inequalities systematically. The average growth of GDP, distribution of income and rate of poverty are also essential economic indicators when seeing these datasets. Because they examined how gender and education can be related with the level of income and social mobility. Together the dataset contributed a valuable perspective towards factors in policy making, social development and the differences between these countries when facing similar problems in education and health inequalities of women around the globe.\nThough this dataset does contain a large quantity of gender related and relevant indicators such as time series data from multiple countries and meta data about the data availability and gaps, it is not entirely inclusive. The datasets cannot reveal coverage of all countries and years between 2000-2023 due to many missing indicators. Due to this lack of data, some high income or small income countries may be severely or slightly underrepresented. We cannot assume that this dataset provides full global coverage. Additionally, people who are considered women, but are not counted on the country level of who is defined as women cannot be portrayed by this data set. For example, women who do not have gender defined on their birth certificate would be excluded from this dataset. Furthermore, non-binary gender identities are absent and can be completely discarded in the portrayal of this set.\nBecause this data comes from the World Bank Group, which pulls its data from each country’s statistical databases, this makes our data susceptible to the ideologies of each country. For example, as our topic is focused on gender inequality and justice, the dataset alone does not describe how each country determines and explores gender identity or who they count in their statistics as “female,” for example. In a similar manner, our dataset has many variables relating to youth education rates. However, the dataset emphasizes formal forms of education, like primary school or trade school, and leaves out informal education which may be more common in less developed countries. Our data alone outlines gender inequality to be a measurable issue that may depend on the development index of each country, but we know that this is not necessarily the case.\nIn addition, it is important to recognize that the World Bank and other contributing international organizations shape the very ontology of this dataset through their own institutional and political frameworks. By emphasizing measurable, standardized indicators that align with development goals such as economic growth or educational attainment, these organizations implicitly define what counts as “progress” or “equality.” This framing can marginalize alternative understandings of gender justice that emphasize cultural, social, or local forms of empowerment. It is up to us to identify the narrative and meaning behind this data to explore what is truly happening with these issues of gender inequality."

    "section": "Our Project",
    "text": "Our Project\nWe are a team of UCLA students investigating how women’s education shapes health outcomes across countries at varying stages of development. Our research explores how education serves as a critical determinant of women’s health by influencing fertility behavior, access to healthcare, and overall knowledge about reproductive and maternal health. We argue that higher levels of education among women correlate with lower fertility rates, as education often delays marriage and childbearing while increasing awareness and use of family planning methods. Moreover, education enhances women’s ability to navigate healthcare systems such as improving access to prenatal and postnatal care, child immunization, and preventive services.\nBeyond access, education empowers women with the knowledge to make informed health decisions, challenge harmful cultural norms, and advocate for their own well-being. By comparing data across countries at different stages of economic and social development, our project seeks to highlight how investments in women’s education not only improve individual health outcomes but also generate broader societal benefits, including reduced maternal mortality, healthier families, and more sustainable population growth. We believe this will allow us to produce a meaningful and inclusive project that will enable individuals around the world to understand our research question.\n\nSources\nThe primary source for our data is the Gender Data Portal, created and funded by the World Bank Group. The portal is maintained by the World Bank’s Gender Group and the Development Economics Data Group, who update the dataset four times per year. Its development and continued improvement are also supported by several multi-donor trust funds, including the Umbrella Facility for Gender Equality, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and other long-term contributors.\nData featured in the Gender Data Portal is collected by national governments and major international organizations responsible for producing official, gender-disaggregated statistics. These contributors include national statistical offices, ministries of labor, health, education, and population, as well as international bodies such as UNDP, UNICEF, UN Women, UNESCO, the International Labour Organization (ILO), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). These organizations gather standardized data from member countries, which the World Bank compiles and organizes within the Gender Data Portal to make global comparisons accessible and reliable.\n\n\nProcessing\nSince we drew our data from the Gender Data Portal, all of our data was drawn individually from the API by key variable name. This data for each variable indexed by economy (which was the country codes), and columned by year. We then had to do extensive processing of our data to get in the format where year was a single column in order to compile a larger dataset with multiple variables. We did this using Python with libraries such as pandas and numpy. After compiling the data in a usable format, we downloaded the raw data with 32 variables as a csv.\nWe then had to do some imputations in order to handle missing values in the data. We did this in R by …\nFor our visualizations, we used Tableau and R to highlight patterns in the data. Tableau powered interactive dashboards that were easy for teammates with less coding experience to build and explore, while R supported more technical, analysis-heavy charts. Some of our team members also leveraged the Plotly library in R to add interactivity to custom graphics. In addition, we used Timeline.js to create an interactive chronology of global birth rates that paired narrative context with visuals.\n\n\nPresentation\nOur site was developed in RStudio using Quarto, hosted on Netlify, and version-controlled with GitHub. The website has a white and mint color palette and texts are in black color to enhance the readability of the website using contrast. Every picture and data visualizations have alt text and descriptive headers to assist readers in their understanding. All headers follows a HTML structure which improves the accessibility of our website and provides directions for users when navigating.\nTo visualize our research outcomes, our website integrats several data visualizations of different variables in our data. The purpose of this was to understand how the level of education for women can impact the right of getting healthcare in different countries. Based on the data collected from the World Bank’s Gender Data Portal, our visualizations highlighted the intersectionality between education, gender equality, birth rate and the holistic social welfare of different societies. Through this work, our goal is to turn statistical data into a human centered narration that explores how education shapes women’s health and futures beyond the classroom."
