{"title":"Data Critique","markdown":{"yaml":{"title":"Data Critique"},"containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n\n\nOur dataset, drawn from the World Bank’s Gender Data Portal (2000–2023), aggregates official statistics on women’s education, health, economic conditions, and demographic structure across countries at different stages of development. It includes human-capital and health indicators (e.g., HCI, antenatal coverage, out-of-pocket health spending), measures of women’s autonomy and reproductive decision-making, education access and parity across levels, labor-force composition by schooling and sex, population and sex-disaggregated demographics, and institutional/legal markers of gender equality. These indicators are standardized for cross-country comparison and repeatedly updated, letting us examine how schooling relates to fertility, disease burden, access/quality of care, income distribution, poverty, and broader growth dynamics. In that sense, the portal is excellent for trend detection, benchmarking progress toward policy targets (e.g., SDGs), and identifying where gaps persist or reforms correlate with improvements.\n\nThe portal’s coverage and cadence are made possible by a specific data ecosystem and funding model. National statistical offices and line ministries provide the core administrative and survey data; international organizations—UNDP, UNICEF, UN Women, UNESCO, ILO, WHO, IMF, among others—harmonize and relay those series; and the World Bank’s Gender Group and DEC Data Group curate, document, and publish them, with support from multi-donor trust funds (e.g., Umbrella Facility for Gender Equality) and philanthropic partners (e.g., the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation). This infrastructure delivers comparability and breadth but also encodes trade-offs: missing years/countries, model-based fill-ins, and uneven depth on sensitive or hard-to-measure topics. Informal or unpaid labor, community health networks, non-formal education, undocumented or legally unrecognized populations (including some transgender and non-binary people), and within-country intersectional disparities often sit at the margins of what the portal can surface. As a result, relying on the portal alone risks mistaking standardized indicators for complete reality.\n\nThese limits are not incidental; they reflect the ontology and politics of measurement that the Bank and its partners institutionalize. Categories like “female,” “access,” “coverage,” “employment,” and “education” are defined through state administrative systems and international frameworks oriented to development logics—formal institutions, legal recognition, fiscal capacity, and donor monitoring priorities. Harmonization privileges comparability over context, smoothing local heterogeneity (e.g., apprenticeship, traditional birth attendants) and reinforcing what funders choose to track and refresh most frequently. We therefore treat the dataset as a high-quality comparative signal rather than ground truth. In practice, we (1) triangulate with household surveys, qualitative and country-specific reports, and time-use or informal-sector proxies; (2) document imputation/modeling flags and data gaps; (3) test sensitivity to alternative definitions (e.g., broader education and work concepts); and (4) interpret cross-country patterns alongside governance capacity and civil-registration coverage.
