These sources include organizations like national statistical offices, labor and health ministries, and agencies responsible for education and population data. At the international level, much of the data comes from the United Nations (UNDP, UNICEF, UN Women), UNESCO, the International Labour Organization (ILO), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). These organizations gather standardized data from member countries, which the World Bank then combines and organizes in the Gender Data Portal so people can easily compare information across countries.\n\nThe World Bank Group is the organization that funded the creation of the dataset. More specifically, the World Bank’s Gender Group and the Development Economics Data Group compiled this data and updated it 4 times a year. In addition, a combination of multi-donor trust funds, such as the Umbrella Facility for Gender Equality, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, etc, that have donated individual contributions for years.\n\nThe dataset from 2000-2023 illuminated the complex relationship between gender equality, education, health and economic development of different countries through the following variable categories:\n\n-   Human Capital & Health: Indicators related to population health, healthcare access, and overall human capital development. These variables reflect overall human capital through the female-specific human capital index\n-   Women’s Autonomy and Reproductive Health: These variables measure women’s empowerment in personal and reproductive decision-making and assess the degree of autonomy, reproductive rights, and access to reproductive health services among women.\n-   Economic Indicators: These variables focus on the broader economic environment, income distribution, and the inclusiveness of economic growth.\n-   Population & Demographic: The demographic variables provide basic structural information about a country’s population, including total population size and the proportion of females.\n-   Education: Education indicators reflect gender parity and access to schooling across different levels. These variables provide insights into gender equality in educational attainment and investment in human capital formation.\n-   Labor Force & Education Level: Labor force indicators describe the distribution of educational attainment among working-age populations, disaggregated by gender.\n-   Gender Equality & Institutional Factors: These variables include institutional-level measures of gender equality\n\nVariables such as Human Capital Index (HCI), literacy rates, and school enrollment gender parity depicted the pattern of females getting education and their success. Index related with prenatal care, reproductive decision-making, and out-of-pocket health expenditures highlighted the fact that in many parts of the world, women are facing medical and health related inequalities systematically. The average growth of GDP, distribution of income and rate of poverty are also essential economic indicators when seeing these datasets. Because they examined how gender and education can be related with the level of income and social mobility. Together the dataset contributed a valuable perspective towards factors in policy making, social development and the differences between these countries when facing similar problems in education and health inequalities of women around the globe.\n\nThough this dataset does contain a large quantity of gender related and relevant indicators such as time series data from multiple countries and meta data about the data availability and gaps, it is not entirely inclusive. The datasets cannot reveal coverage of all countries and years between 2000-2023 due to many missing indicators. Due to this lack of data, some high income or small income countries may be severely or slightly underrepresented. We cannot assume that this dataset provides full global coverage. Additionally, people who are considered women, but are not counted on the country level of who is defined as women cannot be portrayed by this data set. For example, women who do not have gender defined on their birth certificate would be excluded from this dataset. Furthermore, non-binary gender identities are absent and can be completely discarded in the portrayal of this set.\n\nBecause this data comes from the World Bank Group, which pulls its data from each country’s statistical databases, this makes our data susceptible to the ideologies of each country. For example, as our topic is focused on gender inequality and justice, the dataset alone does not describe how each country determines and explores gender identity or who they count in their statistics as “female,” for example. In a similar manner, our dataset has many variables relating to youth education rates. However, the dataset emphasizes formal forms of education, like primary school or trade school, and leaves out informal education which may be more common in less developed countries. Our data alone outlines gender inequality to be a measurable issue that may depend on the development index of each country, but we know that this is not necessarily the case.\n\nIn addition, it is important to recognize that the World Bank and other contributing international organizations shape the very ontology of this dataset through their own institutional and political frameworks. By emphasizing measurable, standardized indicators that align with development goals such as economic growth or educational attainment, these organizations implicitly define what counts as “progress” or “equality.” This framing can marginalize alternative understandings of gender justice that emphasize cultural, social, or local forms of empowerment. It is up to us to identify the narrative and meaning behind this data to explore what is truly happening with these issues of gender inequality.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n![](https://genderdata.worldbank.org/content/dam/sites/data/gender-data/img/2023/gender-portal-logo-2x.png){width=\"500\"}\n\nThe original sources for our dataset, the Gender Data Portal, are national governments and major international organizations that collect official disaggregated gender statistics.
