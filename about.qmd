## Our Project

We are a team of UCLA students investigating how women’s education shapes health outcomes across countries at varying stages of development. Our research explores how education serves as a critical determinant of women’s health by influencing fertility behavior, access to healthcare, and overall knowledge about reproductive and maternal health. We argue that higher levels of education among women correlate with lower fertility rates, as education often delays marriage and childbearing while increasing awareness and use of family planning methods. Moreover, education enhances women’s ability to navigate healthcare systems such as improving access to prenatal and postnatal care, child immunization, and preventive services.

Beyond access, education empowers women with the knowledge to make informed health decisions, challenge harmful cultural norms, and advocate for their own well-being. By comparing data across countries at different stages of economic and social development, our project seeks to highlight how investments in women’s education not only improve individual health outcomes but also generate broader societal benefits, including reduced maternal mortality, healthier families, and more sustainable population growth. We believe this will allow us to produce a meaningful and inclusive project that will enable individuals around the world to understand our research question.
